	<h2>Themes</h2>
	<p>Explore our collections through a series of themes which reflect Australiaâ€™s experience of war including Daily Life at the Front, Love and Friendship, Children in War and Entertainment for the troops. </p>
	<p>Each theme contains a selection of stories, image galleries and articles. Over time we will add new stories and galleries as our collections are digitised, transcribed and interpreted. </p>
